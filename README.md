## About

This application provides an enterprise-style InfoSec dashboard with a collapsible navigation sidebar, integrated chat assistant interface, and routing to multiple security-related applications. The chat currently connects to a mock server for development purposes but is designed to work with an AI-powered agent backend.

---

## Features

### 1. Dashboard

- Collapsed sidebar for minimal distraction  
- Topbar with branding and navigation controls  
- Dashboard grid displaying 4 tiles, each linking to a different application  

### 2. Sidebar Expanded (Dashboard â†’ Expanded State)

- Sidebar expands with icons and labels for 4 applications plus Dashboard (Home)  
- Includes stylized S-logo (SVG) and hamburger toggle icon  
- Layout sync ensures main content area is unaffected by sidebar toggling  

### 3. Sidebar Behavior

- Click outside the sidebar smoothly collapses it  
- Transition animations for smooth expand/collapse  
- Subsequent clicks outside do not trigger unwanted re-expansion  

### 4. Chat Page (Example: Application 3 - Infosec)

- Title bar shows application name and stylized logo  
- Chat panel mimics ChatGPT style with input box, buttons, and icons  
- Chat header displays app name with icon  
- Message panel shows conversation history  
- Input wrapper and UI control panel with buttons for Send, Upload, Download, Clear  

### 5. Chat Page - Typing State

- Send button changes icon to an upward arrow when typing  

### 6. Chat Page - Processing State

- Send button shows a solid square icon during processing  

### 7. Chat Page - Sent State

- Send button returns to original icon after sending  
- Frontend connects to a **mock server endpoint** (`POST /api/chat`) for instant responses  
- Future integration with AI agent team to process uploaded documents via LLM pipeline  

### 8. Upload Button

- Opens file picker dialog for document upload  

### 9. Download Button

- Downloads chat history in a file  

### 10. Application Routing
